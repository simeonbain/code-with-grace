### How does it work?

We run this meetup regularly at Grace Christian Community church's building, Wattle Park Chapel, in Box Hill South. It's a relaxed and open setting to work on something with other developers.

We focus mainly on web development: HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and Node.js (among others). Don't worry if you're not familiar with any of that, we're here to guide you and make it an exciting journey.

Though if you want to work on something else tech related, we'd love to have you too - we just can't guarantee that we'll have the knowledge to help out.

### Who's it for?

Everyone! Whether you're an absolute beginner, a seasoned veteran, or anywhere in between.

For those learning to code for the first time, there are mentors who can guide you from the very beginning and help you to get a grasp of the fundamentals.

For the more experienced, it's a great opportunity for you to learn from others, talk through a difficult problem, or even contribute by helping to mentor others.

### What to bring

- Your laptop
- (Optional) Something to work on - e.g. a project or course

### What we'll provide

- Wifi
- Snacks
- A place to start for beginners
- Mentoring and help for when you get stuck
